On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines moaning out its one old song
You can think about the woman, or the girl you knew the night before
But your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
When you are riding sixteen hours and there's nothing much to do
You don't feel much like riding, you just wish the trip was through
